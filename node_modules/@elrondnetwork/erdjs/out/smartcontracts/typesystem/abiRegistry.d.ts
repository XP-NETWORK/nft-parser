     *
     * A raw type is merely an instance of {@link Type}, with a given name and type parameters (if it's a generic type).
     *
     * Though, for most (development) purposes, we'd like to operate using known, specific types (e.g. {@link List}, {@link U8Type} etc.).
     * This function increases the specificity of the types used by parameter / field definitions within a registry (on best-efforts basis).
     * The result is an equivalent, more explicit ABI registry.
